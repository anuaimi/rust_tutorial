# Rust Tutorial

This repo is being worked as I learn Rust.  The goal is to create a backend server that uses a number of the popular crates including Rocket (web) and Prisma-Rust-Client (database)

## Current Status

- just getting started

## Next Tasks

- create a basic website with Rocket and be able to deploy it to either Fly.io or Railway.app
